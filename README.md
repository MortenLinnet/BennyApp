# Who is Benny Brickeater?

(Update when project is handed over to LEGO)

Robert the Robot is an anthropomorphic interactive storage box that incorporates play facilitation for children during the notoriously boring act of tidying up LEGO bricks. Benny will request various LEGO bricks, animals, or constructions, that the children should feed him with, e.g. “I’ve heard that ice cream is delicious, could you build me one?”. Whenever fed, Benny will give humorous feedback. Benny is constructed from coloured cardboard, a single sheet of plexiglass, and is controlled through an inserted smartphone. Benny can communicate through voice clips and animated eyes to support a wide range of emotions.
